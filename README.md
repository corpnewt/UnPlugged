# UnPlugged
Bash script to help build and run an offline installer in recovery.

***

## Prerequisites

* [UnPlugged](https://github.com/corpnewt/UnPlugged)
* [gibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS)
    *  Or a .dmg/.pkg from the "older versions" (10.7-10.12, excluding 10.9) linked [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102662)
    *  For Mavericks (10.9), see [this thread](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/can-we-download-mavericks-directly-from-apples-servers.2444350/)
* [macrecovery.py](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/tree/master/Utilities/macrecovery) (or [gibMacRecovery](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacRecovery))
* A 16+ GB USB drive
* Your EFI set up by following the [Dortania guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)
* If you're installing Sonoma or later, make sure to read [this section](#notes-for-sonoma-and-later)!

## Pre-Install Steps

1. Download **_the same_** version of macOS via both `gibMacOS` and `macrecovery.py`

    ◦ i.e. If you want to download Ventura, make sure you get Ventura from both `gibMacOS` and `macrecovery.py`

    ◦ They just need to be the same **major** version (i.e. Ventura with Ventura), it **_does not_** need to be the exact same point release (i.e. 13.x.y and 13.x.y)

    ◦ Beta and Apple Silicon specific builds from `gibMacOS` may not work correctly - and may result in an error stating "This version of macOS is not authorized for installation."

3. Format your USB with 2 partitions:
   
    ◦ A FAT32 partition of ~750MB to 1GB (enough to accommodate the EFI and com.apple.recovery.boot folders)

    ◦ An ExFAT partition of the remaining space (needs to be enough to accommodate the files downloaded from `gibMacOS`)

    ◦ **NOTE:** macOS seems to have issues mounting ExFAT partitions whose allocation unit size is greater than 1024 KB.  When formatting the ExFAT partition, ensure that you use an allocation unit size value of 1024 KB or smaller.

5. Copy your EFI folder and the com.apple.recovery.boot folder over to the FAT32 partition
6. Copy the files downloaded from gibMacOS to the ExFAT partition

    ◦ You'll be `cd`ing to this partition later - so it may make sense to label it something easy to type like `UnPlugged`

7. Copy `UnPlugged.command` to the ExFAT partition as well
8. **_Eject the USB drive_** - this ensures any pending cached writes are applied and can help prevent corrupt or incomplete file copies
9. Boot into the recovery environment

<details>
<summary>Example USB Structure</summary>

After formatting and copying things to their respective locations, your USB should look something like this:
```
USB Drive
|-> 750+MB FAT32 Partition (named OPENCORE or similar)
|   |-> EFI
|   \-> com.apple.recovery.boot
|       |-> BaseSystem.dmg
|       \-> BaseSystem.chunklist
\-> 15+GB ExFAT Partition (named UnPlugged or similar)
    |-> Files from gibMacOS (InstallAssistant.pkg, InstallESDDmg.pkg, etc)
    \-> UnPlugged.command
```
</details>

***

## Recovery Environment Steps

1. Open Disk Utility
2. Enable View -> Show All Devices
3. Format the target **device** (not the volume) for your macOS version

     ◦ Sierra and prior should be macOS Extended (Journaled) with a GUID Partition Map

     ◦ High Sierra and newer should be APFS with a GUID Parititon Map

5. Quit Disk Utility
6. Open Terminal
7. Type `cd /Volumes/[your ExFAT volume name]`

    ◦ You can get a list of all volumes with `ls /Volumes`

    ◦ Make sure to replace `[your ExFAT volume name]` with the name of the volume containing gibMacOS files and `UnPlugged.command`

    ◦ e.g. If you named the volume `UnPlugged`, you would do `cd /Volumes/UnPlugged`

8. Type `./UnPlugged.command` to launch the script

    ◦ If that does not work - you can type `bash UnPlugged.command`

***

## UnPlugged.command Steps

1. The script will assess available approaches for locating the `Install [macOS version].app` needed, and may prompt you to choose from a list of two or more of the following:
   
    ◦ `Fully expand InstallAssistant.pkg - slower, but no risk of app mismatch` - if leveraging InstallAssistant.pkg on a recovery env where `pkgutil` supports the `--expand-full` switch (most do)
   
    ◦ `Extract the Install [macOS version].app from BaseSystem.dmg` - if a BaseSystem.dmg or RecoveryImage.dmg is detected next to InstallAssistant.pkg
   
    ◦ `Choose a locally discovered Install [macOS version].app` - if any installers were detected locally
   
2. The script should auto-detect the required files - but if it does not, it will prompt for the path to them here
3. The script will then prompt asking for the target volume - this is the volume that you just created in Disk Utility.  The one where you intend to install macOS
4. Then you'll be presented with a task list - and asked if you want to continue - type `y` and enter
5. The script will build the full install app and launch it from the Terminal for you - continue the rest of the install as normal

    ◦ Make sure to leave the Terminal open - do not quit it, as doing so will also quit the installer.

## Notes for Sonoma and Later

It seems the Sonoma+ BaseSystem.dmg recovery environment does not allow mounting FAT32 or ExFAT volumes at all.  To work around this using UnPlugged requires a couple extra steps.

You'll need to use an earlier BaseSystem.dmg|.chunklist downloaded via `macrecovery.py` in your com.apple.recovery.boot folder (Monterey works fine with FAT32 and ExFAT volumes).  You'll also need to download Sonoma's BaseSystem.dmg via `macrecovery.py` and place that alongside the files downloaded with `gibMacOS` if you don't intend to expand the InstallAsisstant.pkg directly.  The end result should look something like the following:

```
USB Drive
|-> 750+MB FAT32 Partition (named OPENCORE or similar)
|   |-> EFI
|   \-> com.apple.recovery.boot
|       |-> BaseSystem.dmg (for Monterey)
|       \-> BaseSystem.chunklist (for Monterey)
\-> 15+GB ExFAT Partition (named UnPlugged or similar)
    |-> InstallAssistant.pkg (for Sonoma+)
    |-> BaseSystem.dmg (for Sonoma+, if not expanding the .pkg directly)
    \-> UnPlugged.command
```

When prompted to select where you would like to get the `Install [macos Version].app` from, selecting `Extract the Install [macOS version].app from BaseSystem.dmg` will leverage the provided BaseSystem.dmg.

The rest of the process should be the same as with prior OS versions.

<summary>Note: There *are* ways to manually mount the ExFAT volume in Sonoma+ recovery</summary>

You can use the following approach to locate your ExFAT volume's identifier and manually mount it if you're familiar with the command line:

```sh
# Show a list of all the physically connected disks and their
# volumes:
diskutil list physical
# Create a folder where you'd like to mount the ExFAT volume,
# the directory name must be unique, and not already exist:
mkdir /Volumes/UnPlugged
# Mount the ExFAT volume at that location - replace "diskXsY" with
# your ExFAT volume's identifier:
/sbin/mount_exfat /dev/diskXsY /Volumes/UnPlugged
```

You should also be able to mount the FAT32 volume by performing the above steps using `/sbin/mount_msdos` instead of `/sbin/mount_exfat`.
